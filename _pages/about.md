Research interests
1. systems neuroscience approaches to understand functional interactions in the human brain
2. M/EEG signal processing and data analysis
3. reproducibility in neuroimaging, open science data & metadata management

My path so far:
- I worked towards my PhD in the [MEG group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-4/DE/Forschung/MEG-Physik/_node.html) under the supervision of Dr. Jürgen Dammers and Prof. N. J. Shah at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-4), Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany.
- Currently working in the Neural Circuits and Cognition Lab at the [Max Planck Institute of Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html), Frankfurt/Main, Germany.
