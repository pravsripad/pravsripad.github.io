As a researcher working in the field of neuroimaging, I am interested in systems neuroscience approaches to understanding the functional brain. Currently I use M/EEG to study activity and connectivity in the human brain in the resting state. 

I am working towards my PhD under the supervision of Dr. Jürgen Dammers and Prof. N. J. Shah at the Insitute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-4), Forschungszentrum Jülich.
