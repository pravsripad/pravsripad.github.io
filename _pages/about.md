Research interests

1. applied machine learning / deep learning
2. reproducibility in neuroimaging, open science data and metadata management
3. systems neuroscience approaches to understand functional interactions in the human brain
4. M/EEG signal processing and data analysis

My path so far:

- Worked towards my PhD in the [MEG group now restructured as the Data Science group](https://www.fz-juelich.de/en/inm/inm-4/neuro-image-date-science) under the supervision of Dr. Jürgen Dammers and Prof. N. J. Shah at the Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-4), Forschungszentrum Jülich, Germany.
- Worked in the [Neural Circuits, Cognition and Consciousness Lab](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en/research/research-group-neural-circuits-consciousness-and-cognition.html) at the [Max Planck Institute of Empirical Aesthetics](https://www.aesthetics.mpg.de/en.html), Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Here I worked on the [Cogitate](https://www.arc-cogitate.com/) project.
- **Currently working as a data scientist at the Data Innovation Lab, AXA Konzern AG, Germany.**
